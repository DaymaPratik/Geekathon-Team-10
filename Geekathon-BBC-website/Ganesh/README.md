# Project Name : - BBC Clone Project 

## Task Overview

For this project, I had to make the Sounds Page. I used HTML and CSS to create a good-looking and working version of the BBC's Sounds page. The aim was to make our version look a lot like the real BBC website, so people could use it easily.

## Description

In developing the Sound Page section, I utilized HTML tags alongside CSS styles. This combination was essential in achieving the desired layout and visual presentation. Allow me to provide you with an overview of the steps I took.

### HTML Tags:

- **Semantic Structure:** Employed HTML5 semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<navbar>`, `<main>`, `<section>` and `<footer>` to provide a clear and meaningful structure to the page content.
- **Headlines and Text Content:** Utilized `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<span>` tags to define headlines, paragraphs, and inline text content throughout the page.
- **Links:** Employed `<a>` tags to create hyperlinks for navigation and article redirection.
- **Images:** Utilized `<img>` tags to insert images, enhancing the visual appeal of the page.

### CSS Styles:

- **Layout:**  I used CSS Flexbox to organize page elements in a way that looks good on any screen.
- **Typography:** I made text look nice by picking special `font-family`, `font-size`, `color`, and `line-height` using CSS.
- **Colors and Backgrounds:** Defined color schemes and background colors using CSS properties like `background-color`, `color`, and `background-image`.
- **Spacing and Padding:** Utilized `margin` and `padding` properties to control the spacing between elements and provide visual hierarchy.
- **Responsive Design:** Employed CSS Media Queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **Hover Effects:** Added CSS hover effects to enhance interactivity, such as changing the color or scale of elements when hovered over by the user.

By leveraging these HTML tags and CSS styles effectively, I was able to craft a visually appealing and functional Home Page section that closely mirrors the design and functionality of the original BBC website.
